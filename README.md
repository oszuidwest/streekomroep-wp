# The Streekomroep WordPress theme

This is a WordPress theme made for Streekomroep ZuidWest in The Netherlands. It's made using Timber and Tailwind CSS and provides functionality for regional news, radio and tv broadcasts. 

## Installation
This is a WordPress theme with some hard dependencies. You can't run it without these dependencies.

1. Install WordPress 5.9.x
2. Install and activate the hard dependencies
3. Upload the theme to your `wp-content/themes`
4. Switch to the `streekomroep` theme

### Hard dependencies

## What's here?

`static/` is where you can keep your static front-end scripts, styles, or images. In other words, your Sass files, JS files, fonts, and SVGs would live here.

`templates/` contains all of your Twig templates. These pretty much correspond 1 to 1 with the PHP files that respond to the WordPress template hierarchy. At the end of each PHP template, you'll notice a `Timber::render()` function whose first parameter is the Twig file where that data (or `$context`) will be used. Just an FYI.

`bin/` and `tests/` ... basically don't worry about (or remove) these unless you know what they are and want to.

## How to build

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npx tailwindcss-cli build assets/style.css  -o dist/style.css
composer install --prefer-dist --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```
